# Crayner AI

We are the one who started with program that says `Hello World` and we never stay. 
We put a wrong condition in an if else statement but compile it and run it anyway. 
Our only goal is to make Team Leaders dream come true.
So we copy our code from stackoverflow.

Our life is stuck in an infinite for{ } loop, till our kindom come.

If you see someone with a lonely life, He is an Engineer a Software Engineer,
Google Infosys and Intel Inside.
Are our Dream Companies.



```java
System.out.print("My life sucks so bad");
```
Give me a header file...
```java
import java.life;
```



Your eyes they shine so bright.
I think you have got a life.
If you want it to go, COME WITH US ONBOARD... !
